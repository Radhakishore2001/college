                Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Khalsa College, a constituent college of University of Delhi, was established in 1951 and is maintained by Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee (DSGMC), a statutory body established under an act of the Parliament of India. The focus of the College at the time of inception was to ensure a comprehensive social transformation through access to quality education, in particular to young Punjabi Refugees of Partition in 1947, and to conserve and promote Punjabi language, culture, and heritage. The College is named after Ninth Guru - Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur, who sacrificed his life to uphold secular values, and is an institution with cosmopolitan environment and progressive outlook.
                Over the years, the College has carved a niche for itself and is known to be one of the leading colleges of University. At present there are 18 undergraduate programmes, 2 B.Tech. programmes, 12 postgraduate programmes, one postgraduate diploma, 2 undergraduate diplomas, and 9 certificate courses, making a total of 44 programmes. During the current session 2015-16 there are 3,768 students in these programmes, and 140 full-time teachers, out of which 101 are permanent with 7 on leave/lien. During last four years, 57 teachers participated in various staff-development programmes.<br><br>
                The College has 59 classrooms, 19 well-equipped labs, 6 research labs, excellent indoor and outdoor sports facilities, gymnasium, cafeteria, bank, and medical facilities in very close proximity, besides other utility services such as post-office and market. The College is well connected by road and Delhi Metro link, and majority students are day-scholars. A Hostel for Girls can accommodate 147 inmates, and a Hostel for Boys is planned to come up soon.
    
    College has been growing at a rapid pace since last few years. In the next session, five new courses will be started, consequent to the official communication by the University, regarding grant of the approval for the same. Keeping this in view, and the future expansion, the College has prepared a new Masterplan for expansion which shall include state-of-the-art new academic building, residences, parking, utility and common areas housed in multi-storied complex. As and when the necessary approvals are obtained, and the funds are available, this new project shall commence immediately.
